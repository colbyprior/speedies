### Spellcasting
If you run, charge or are engaged in melee combat then the difficulty of spellcasting is increased by +2.

### Shooting from elevation
If you are within half range and elevated by at least 2” of the target you are shooting at, you get Advantage on your Ranged check. You may choose to shoot anyone that is at least 2” lower than you as opposed to the nearest target.

### Reloading ranged weapons
You must forgo your movement to reload this weapon. It cannot be fired again until it has been reloaded.

### Shooting modifiers

| Cover           | -3 Piercing |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Moved this turn | -3 Piercing |
| Large opponent  | +3 Piercing |

### Falling
When falling, simply roll on the Injury chart. For every extra full inch above 2” that the unit falls from, add +2 to the Injury roll. A roll of 1-11 has no effect.

### Jumping
Make an agility check to jump across a gap of up to 3” and a height of up to 1”. If you fail then you fall.

### Dropping down
Instead of climbing a unit may drop down a ledge for no movement cost. Make a single agility check to successfully drop down, if you fail you fall. If you instead opt to climb down a failed climb check does not result in falling.

### Diving charge
If as part of your charge you make a drop down check and the target of the charge is within 3” of the drop down point you roll your attacks with advantage.

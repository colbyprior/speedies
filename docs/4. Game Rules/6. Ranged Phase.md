# Ranged Phase

In this phase you may make Ranged Attacks with your units. A unit may not make a Ranged Attack if they:

* do not have a Ranged Weapon
* are [Engaged](docs/4.%20Game%20Rules/3.%20Engage%20Phase.md) in Melee
* have [Ran](docs/4.%20Game%20Rules/4.%20Move%20Phase.md#running) this turn
* have [Cast a Spell](docs/4.%20Game%20Rules/5.%20Cast%20Phase.md) this turn
* are Stunned
* are Dazed
* have already made a Ranged Attack this turn

In the Ranged Phase, you pick one of your units that can make a Ranged Attack and resolve it. This continues until you have either resolved all available Ranged Attacks or do not want to make any more Ranged Attacks, at which point the phase ends.

This Phase is skipped during the first player's first turn of the game.

## Picking a Target for Shooting
By default, the closest enemy to the Shooting unit that meets the following requirements is the only valid target to be shot at:
* Is in Line-of-Sight
* Is not Engaged

There are four exceptions to this:
1. If the closest enemy is in Cover, then the closest enemy not in Cover can be targeted instead
2. Enemies that are Stunned or Dazed can be ignored for the purposes of targeting
3. Any Large enemy can be targeted
4. Any enemy that is at least 2" below the Shooting unit can be targeted

Example to use:
From closest to furthest:
Stunned in Cover (Can shoot)
Stunned in Cover (Can shoot)
In Cover (Can shoot)
In Cover (Cannot shoot)
Not In Cover (Can shoot)
Not In Cover (Cannot shoot)
Large (Can shoot)
Someone that is at least 2" below the shooter (Can shoot)

Give explanation why each can or cannot be shot at

## Being Elevated

If an enemy is at least 2" below your Shooting unit, they may be targeted by your unit. In addition, if the target is within half range of the Ranged Weapon being used (this can only be measured after declaring the target to be Shot at), then the unit Shooting has Advantage on their Ranged Check.

## Cover

When Shooting at an enemy, if Line-of-Sight to the target is partially blocked by anything (eg. other units or terrain), then the target is said to have 'Cover'. This means that the shot will be less likely to hit the target as the shooter will have a negative Piercing Modifier (ie. the enemy's Defence Check will be easier).

If any part of the target's physical body is blocked from view, they have Cover. An exception to this is Clothing, equipment, or any other part of the model that would not physically hurt the unit if hit. In this case, if it was shot it does not count towards providing cover if it is blocked from view.

Similarly to how exaggerated model poses (eg. hands of a model held high above their head) do not provide Line-of-Sight if it are the only part of the model's body showing, the target does not gain Cover if it is the only part of the model's body blocked from view.

## Shooting
<!--
JP 25-03-25: Add a simple overview of how to resolve a Shot.
-->

1. Declare which of your units is attempting to Shoot, and which model is the target, based on the targeting rules
2. Measure to see if the unit is within range to shoot
	1. If the unit is not within range, the Shot automatically misses
3. Perform a Ranged Check (remember the value!)
	1. If you are within half-range and at least 2" above the target you are shooting at, you get Advantage on your Ranged check
	2. If you roll a natural 20, you score a Critical Hit. Treat the attack as if you had rolled two 20s instead (ie. the opponent needs to roll two Defence checks and resolve them individually)
4. If you pass, your opponent performs a Defence Check (see the modifiers below)
5. If they fail, you reduce their Wounds by 1
	1. If this lowers their Wounds to 0, you Injure them based on what you rolled in Step 3 (see the Injuries section for how this is handled)
	2. If they are Incapacitated, draw from the Improvement Deck


## Shooting Modifiers

There are a number of situations that can modify the Piercing value of a weapon being used to Shoot. If the target has cover or the Shooting unit has Moved this turn, the target will have an easier Defence Check to avoid being Injured.

| Situation                         | Piercing Modifier |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Target has cover                  | -3                |
| Shooting unit has Moved this turn | -3                |

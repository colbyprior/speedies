# Injury
Whenever someone is Injured, see the following table for the result. This is used for both melee combat, ranged combat, some spells and other checks like falling.

| Attack d20 Roll | Result                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1-11            | Knocked Down (or no effect in some cases) |
| 12-14           | Knocked Down                              |
| 15-17           | Stunned                                   |
| 18-20           | Out of Action                             |

## Targeting units knocked down or stunned in melee
You may only target a unit in melee when they are knocked down or stunned if you are engaged with no other units that are able to fight back.

## Attacking a unit that is knocked down or stunned
See the table below for resolving whether someone is put Out of Action through Close Combat attacks on Stunned/Knocked Down:

| Status       | How To Out of Action                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knocked Down | Melee check with Advantage, Defence check as normal         |
| Stunned      | Out of Action automatically (but costs one attack to do so) |

## When a hero takes out any unit
Heroes that take out enemy units gain one experience point.

## When a henchmen takes out any unit
Immediately roll on the table below. If they succeed they will become a hero after this scenario. They retain their experience and immediately gain one level up. If they are knocked out of action this scenario roll on the hero injury chart instead of the henchmen injury chart.

| Henchmen OOA hero   | 18+ |
| ------------------- | --- |
| Henchmen OOA leader | 15+ |

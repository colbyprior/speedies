# Charging phase
Charging is how your units get into melee with enemy units.
1. When you charge a model, declare to your opponent that you are doing so and indicate which of his models it is attacking.
  :::tip[When to decide the path]
  You may jump, climb or make a diving charge as part of this movement if possible however you must decide if you are going to take these actions before measuring.
  :::
2. If your warrior does not have line of sight of the unit they are charging then you must roll an out of sight roll.
3. Afterwards measure to see if your unit has enough movement to get into base to base with the enemy unit.
  :::tip[Charge speed]
  When charging you may move a number of inches equal to your movement characteristic multiplied by 1.5. Eg. a unit with 6 movement may change 9 inches.

  :::tip[Charging path]
  b. Your unit must make the most direct path towards the enemy unit.
  :::
  :::danger[Failed charges]
  c. If your unit cannot reach the target then it becomes a failed charge.
  :::
4. Check to see if any units are able to intercept the charge along their path.
5. If not intercepted, move the unit appropriately.

# Out of sight rolls

When charging a unit that your unit does not have line of sight of roll on this table. If as a result you fail the charge you still move towards the target the distance specified from the table.

| d20   | Charge distance                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-5   | Charge distance becomes half of base Move characteristic in inches             |
| 6-15  | Charge distance becomes full base Move characteristic in inches                |
| 16-20 | Charge distance is as normal (Move characteristic in inches multiplied by 1.5) |

## Failed charge

Sometimes a charging warrior may not reach the enemy because you have miscalculated the distance. If this happens move your warrior his normal move distance towards the enemy. This is called a failed charge. The model cannot shoot in the same turn in which he failed a charge however a unit can still cast spells after a failed charge.

Models cannot be moved into hand-to-hand combat except by charging – any move that brings a warrior into hand-to-hand combat is a charge by definition. A model that charges will ‘strike first’ in the first round of the ensuing combat.

## Intercepting charges
If an unengaged (ie, not in hand-to-hand combat) enemy model lies within 2" of the charge route, that model may choose to intercept the charger if he wishes. This ‘interception area’ is shown in the diagram below. Only one enemy model may attempt to intercept each charger. If the intercepting warrior would normally require a Fear test to engage the charger then he must pass one in order to be allowed to intercept. Failure means he will not move.

If the intercepting warrior causes fear then move the models into contact and then take a Fear test for the original charger (assuming he would normally do so) as if he was the one being charged. Regardless of the results of this test it is still the original charger who counts as charging in the subsequent round of combat, not the intercepting warrior.

## Charging more than one opponent
If you can move your warrior into base contact with more than one enemy model with its charge move, it can charge them both. This might be inadvisable as it’ll then be fighting two enemies at once!

## Diving charge
If as part of your charge you make a drop down check and the target of the charge is within 3” of the drop down point you roll your attacks with advantage.

## Making room for a charge
If a unit is on the edge of a ledge or top of a ladder you may still charge them. If there is not enough room for your unit to be placed next to the unit charged then shuffle it back to make room. You may not shuffle any units that are already engaged in combat in this way.

## Frenzy and charging
If a unit has frenzy measure to see if they can charge anyone at the end of the charging phase. If they can make a charge without making any agility checks then they must do so.

## Fear
If an enemy unit causes fear you must make a morale check in order to charge them. If you fail the fear check you do not move this turn and may not shoot or cast spells.

If your unit causes fear and you charge an enemy unit they must make a morale check. If they fail they get negative 4 piercing to their attacks for the first round of combat.

If both units cause fear then neither must make any morale checks.

### Failing fear checks
| When charging | Failed charge                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Being charged | -4 Piercing in first round of combat |

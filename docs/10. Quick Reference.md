### General
#### Injuries for Melee/Ranged Attacks

| Attack d20 Roll | Result        |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 1-11            | Dazed         |
| 12-14           | Dazed         |
| 15-17           | Stunned       |
| 18-20           | Incapacitated |

#### Injury Rolls

| d20 Roll | Result        |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1-11     | Dazed         |
| 12-14    | Dazed         |
| 15-17    | Stunned       |
| 18-20    | Incapacitated |

#### Plague Effects

The Plague has the following effects during battle:

1. Units with the plague gain Advantage on Melee Checks during the turn of any new combat.
2. If a unit Incapacitates or is Incapacitated by a unit with the Plague in Melee, they must make a Morale Check. If it fails, they immediately contract the Plague.
	1. If the unit that was Incapacitated already has the Plague then nothing happens.






### Engaging

#### Out-of-Sight Rolls

| d20   | Charge distance              |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 1-5   | Half of base Move            |
| 6-15  | Full base Move               |
| 16-20 | Charge distance is as normal |
#### Jump Attack
A unit may perform a Jump Attack under all of the following conditions:
- As part of your Engage you make a successful Jump Down check
- Where you land after your Jump Down check directly engaged with a unit

If you successfully perform a Jump Attack you roll your attacks with Advantage for the current turn.

#### Fear

| Morale Check Result | Effect                                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Passed Morale check | Nothing happens                               |
| Failed Morale check | Roll all attacks with disadvantage this round |




### Moving

#### Jumping
Make an agility check to jump across a gap of up to 3” and a height of up to 1”. If you fail then you fall.
#### Dropping down

Now an Agility Check must be made to see whether the unit safely landed. If the distance being jumped is 4" or more vertically, the unit makes the Agility Check with Disadvantage. On a success, it lands and may continue Moving as normal. If it fails if Falls, stopping where it landed. Resolve Falling as normal.

#### Falling damage
When falling, simply roll on the Injury chart. For every extra full inch above 2” that the unit falls from, add +2 to the Injury roll. A roll of 1-11 has no effect.

#### Difficult Terrain

-2" to total Move



### Casting

#### Spellcasting Modifiers
If you run, charge or are engaged in melee combat then the difficulty of spellcasting is increased by +2.

#### Ongoing Spells

If the Caster is Stunned or Incapacitated, the Ongoing Spell immediately ends.



### Ranged

#### Shooting from elevation
If you are within half range and elevated by at least 2” of the target you are shooting at, you get Advantage on your Ranged check. You may choose to shoot anyone that is at least 2” lower than you as opposed to the nearest target.

#### Shooting modifiers

| Modifer         | Effect      |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Cover           | -3 Piercing |
| Moved this turn | -3 Piercing |




### Melee

#### Attacking a unit that is dazed or stunned

See the table below for resolving whether someone is Incapacitated through Close Combat attacks on Stunned/Dazed:

| Status  | How To Incapacitate                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

### Buying Hero Slots

Players can spend gold to increase their total Hero Slots and enable them to hire Heroes beyond the usual 3. This can be especially useful if the player has gotten unlucky with Henchman Promotion roles and is feeling limited by their Hero Slots. See the following table for the cost required to buy a Hero slot. The costs listed are not cumulative.

| Hero Slot | Cost |
| --------- | ---- |
| 4th       | 50g  |
| 5th       | 100g |
| 6th       | 150g |
### Buying Improvement Attempts

Players can spend 25g to allow a Hero to make an Improvement Attempt. Draw once from the Improvement Deck for that Hero and resolve the card. Each Hero can only attempt to Improve once between each game.

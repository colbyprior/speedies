## Law Faction Agents
### egg5 (Law)
*Agent:* _Human High Priest_

As the, now disgraced, head of the church within the city, blah has been heavily criticised for allowing the Blight to spread to all corners of the city. He is commonly seen throughout the city doing his best to heal the diseased and occasionally smite the forces of Chaos.

# Underworld
## Underworld Faction Agents
### Snikit (Underworld)
*Agent:* _Ratling Assassin's Guild Leader_

Some say Snikit went mad after being hit with a stray projectile. Others say he went mad after cracking his skull on a slippery sewer floor. Either way, this crazy Ratling rules the Assassin's Guild with an iron claw - at least when he feels like it.

### egg2 (Underworld)
*Agent:* _Elvish Thief_

Frustratingly agile, blah is always one step ahead of everyone else. A thief notorious amongst the nobility, she is the mastermind behind numerous high-profile heists.

Demonic portal opens. Will appear in 1-2 turns (enough for player to react for one turn).

Order has a chance to convince the demon to help them. Will turn hostile if fails.
### egg4 (Chaos)
*Agent:* _Human Cult Leader_

This self-proclaimed 'Prophet of the Blight' has supposedly been sent by greater powers to spread the gift of the Blight to all who will listen, and to all who won't. Blah's sermons, and those of his followers, bring a sense of foreboding to all those unlucky enough to hear them.

## Necromantic Magic 
| Name | Diff | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Raise Dead | 7 | One allied Zombie or Skeleton that was Incapacitated after the end of your last turn immediately returns to the battle, no longer counting towards your Rout Threshold. Place the model within 5" of the Caster. The model cannot be placed such that it is Engaged with an enemy. |
| Soul Rend | 12 | Basic. Cast Attack. Target one unit you can see within 15" and perform a Cast Attack against them. If this spell Incapacitates the target, create a Zombie where it was Incapacitated. It is an ally to you and will count towards your Rout Threshold. |
| Control Dead | 10 | Choose a point within 5" of the caster. Any allied Zombies or Skeletons within 1.5" of that point may immediately move again up to their Move. If this moves them into base contact with an enemy unit, they count as Engaging. |
| Lifestealer | 16 | Choose a single unit within 5". The target suffers a Wound (no check required) and is automatically Incapacitated if this is its last Wound. The caster gains an extra Wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the caster's Wounds above its maximum value. This spell does not affect Undead units. |
| Hex | 13 | Ongoing. Choose a single enemy within 10". The target has Disadvantage on all Checks it makes. |

## Life Magic

| Invisibility | 12 | Ongoing. Choose one ally within 5" (including themselves). This unit is treated as no longer existing for the purposes of targeting or blocking Movement, line-of-sight or picking up Treasure. If it is Engaged, it is no longer Engaged and moves 1". If this unit Engages, casts a Spell, or makes a Ranged attack, the spell ends. |
| Control Earth | 10 | Choose a point within 10". Place a piece of natural terrain (a wood, mesa, etc.) at that point. The terrain cannot be larger than 3" in any dimension. Some leniency should be made if it fits the spirit of the spell. The terrain must fit within the space. If this is cast on a unit, move that unit to the closest space that it can be safely placed (this may be within or on the new terrain). |
| Root | 11 | Ongoing. Choose one unit within 20". That unit cannot Engage, Move, or Run. |
| Earthquake | 13 | All units within 10" must make an Agility check or become Dazed. |

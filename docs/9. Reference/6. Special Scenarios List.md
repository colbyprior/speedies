## Law vs Chaos Scenarios

### The Blight

*The forces of Chaos are trying to spread the Blight throughout the district. It's up to the forces of the Law to contain it.*

**Law Faction Objective:** Protect the bystanders while they retreat

**Chaos Faction Objective:** Spread the Blight by Incapacitating the bystanders in Melee

**Map:** Dense City

**Deployment:** Randomly determine which board edge Chaos will deploy on. Set up the bystanders (see below) based on this, then Chaos deploys within 2" of that board edge. Finally Law deploys within 2" of the opposite board edge.

**Turn Order:** Chaos, Law, Neutral

**Rout Threshold:**

**Special Rules:**

*Bystanders*: There are X bystanders set up as follows (add diagram). Each turn, they Retreat towards the Law player's starting board edge. They have the stats of a Peasant (see the Inquisitor warband). They are Neutral to the Law player and Hostile to the Chaos player.

If they would be Incapacitated outside of Melee, they are Stunned instead. For every bystander that is Incapacitated, this lowers the Law player's Rout Threshold by 1. For every bystander that successfully Retreats from the board, this lowers the Chaos player's Rout Threshold by 1.



## Chaos vs Underworld Scenarios

### Coup

*Faction Agents of both sides try to depose each other to gain power.*

**Chaos Faction Objective:** Incapacitate the Underworld Faction Agent while allowing their own Faction Agent to Retreat

**Underworld Faction Objective:** Incapacitate the Chaos Faction Agent while allowing their own Faction Agent to Retreat

**Map:** Two parallel streets in dense city (see diagram).

**Deployment:** Roll to determine deployment order as normal. The first player sets up within 2" of either of the board edges where the streets start/finish. The player places their Faction Agent along the board edge so that it's in the middle of one of the two streets. The second player sets up within 2" of the opposite board edge, then places their Faction Agent along the board edge so that it's in the middle of the other of the two streets.

**Turn Order:** First player's Faction Agent, first player, second player's Faction Agent, second player

**Rout Threshold:**

**Special Rules:**

*Faction Agents:* Players do not have direct control over their Faction Agent during the battle. Instead, before each player's turn (including the first one), each Faction Agent moves along the street towards the opposite board edge from where they started, Retreating towards that point. Faction Agents will always Disengage from Melee at the start of their turn. If they have Ranged Weapons, they can use it.

If a Faction Agent successfully Retreats, it lowers the opponent's Rout Threshold by 3. If a Faction Agent is Incapacitated, it lowers their ally's Rout Threshold by 3 (rather than the usual 1).

*Demon Lord:* Should the Chaos player have the Demon Lord as their Faction Agent, it will have the Temporary Ally special rule as normal. If it becomes Hostile to the Chaos warband, it will stop Retreating and make Normal Actions for the rest of the game instead.


## Underworld vs Law Scenarios

### Jailbreak

*The Underworld Faction has just broken their Faction Agent out of jail. The alarm has been raised, but can the Law Faction catch them in time?*

Underworld Faction Objective: Have their Faction Agent Retreat

Law Faction Objective: Capture the Underworld Faction Agent

Map: Dense City with a jail in the middle.

Deployment: The Underworld warband deploys within 5" of the centre of the board. The Law warband deploys within 2" of all board edges. Neither side deploys their Faction Agents at the beginning of the game.

**Turn Order:** Underworld, Neutral, Law

**Rout Threshold:**

Special Rules:

*Hooded Figures:* The Underworld warband has four Hooded Figures, which are Neutral units. Chosen randomly, one of these is the Underworld Faction Agent. This information is secret to both players. After each Underworld player turn, each one Retreats towards a different corner of the board. They have Move 6 and have no Defence for the purposes of being targeted by Ranged Attacks.

When a Law unit is within 5" and Line-of-Sight of a Hooded Figure, it is immediately revealed whether it is the Faction Agent or not. If it's not, it instead appears as a Underworld Henchman, allied with the Underworld warband. Whenever it becomes certain what identity a Hooded Figure is (either because it must be the Faction Agent or because the Faction Agent is revealed), the Hooded Figure is revealed. Should a Hooded Figure successfully Retreat off of any corner, it is revealed.

If Hooded Figures or the Faction Agent would be Incapacitated outside of Melee, they are Stunned instead. Henchman revealed from Hooded Figures can be Incapacitated as normal and count towards the Underworld player's Rout Threshold.

Once the Underworld Faction Agent is revealed, it is now controllable by the Underworld player (unless it has already Retreated). When this happens, the Law player's Faction Agent is immediately placed on the board edge so that it is as closed to the Underworld Faction Agent as possible. If the Law Faction Agent was placed during the Neutral turn, it cannot do anything on the Law player's next turn. If it was revealed during the Law player's turn, it cannot do anything for the rest of that turn.

The Underworld Faction Agent can Retreat off of any corner once it is revealed. If it successfully Retreats at any point, it reduces the Law player's Rout Threshold by 3. Should it be Incapacitated, it reduces the Underworld player's Rout Threshold by 3.

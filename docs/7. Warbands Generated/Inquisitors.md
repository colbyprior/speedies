| Steadfast | 12 | Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear. In addition, the whole warband gains +2 on any Morale tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, ie, the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +2. |

| Heal | 5 | Any one model within 2" of the caster (including themself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2" are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal. |

# Shoot Phase
In this phase you may shoot or cast spells with your units.
- Units that are Engaged in melee combat may not shoot
- Units that have Run this turn may not shoot
- Units that are stunned or dazed may not shoot or cast spells
- Spellcasting may still be performed even in melee or after running with +2 difficulty

## Picking a target for shooting
There are a number of conditions that affect who may be the target of a ranged attack:
- Your unit must have line of sight to the target
- If your unit is at least 2" above any enemy units that they can see they may target them
- Otherwise, you must shoot the closest target
- You may instead opt to shoot the next closest enemy that is not in cover if the closest enemy is in cover
- You may not shoot enemies that are engaged in melee combat

## Shooting
1. Declare which of your units is attempting to Shoot, and which model is the target, based on the targeting rules
2. You measure to see if you are within range to shoot
3. Perform a Ranged check (remember the value!)
	1. If you are within half-range and at least 2" above the target you are shooting at, you get Advantage on your Ranged check
	2. If you roll a natural 20, you score a Critical Hit and immediately skip to Step 4
4. If you pass, your opponent performs a Defense check (see the modifiers below)
5. If they fail, you reduce their Wounds by 1
	1. If this lowers their wounds to 0, you Injure them based on what you rolled in Step 3 (see the Injuries section for how this is handled)

## Shooting Defense Modifiers
| Situation                | Defence Modifier |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Your opponent has cover  | -3 Piercing      |
| You have moved this turn | -3 Piercing      |
| Your opponent is Large   | +3 Piercing      |



## Reloading
Certain weapons may require reloading. A weapon may be reloaded in the movement phase instead of moving.

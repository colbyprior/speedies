# Cast Phase

This Phase is skipped during the first player's first turn of the game.
## Casting Spells
A unit may Cast Spells during the Cast Phase, as long as it is not Stunned or Dazed. To perform a Cast Check, a unit must roll equal to or higher than the difficulty of the Spell. Depending on the Spell, how well you rolled to Cast the Spell may be relevant.

If the Cast Check fails, nothing happens. If it succeeds, the Spell is resolved as per its description.

If a unit attempts to Cast a Spell, they cannot Shoot in the same turn, regardless of whether the Cast Check was successful or not.

## Casting Modifiers
If the Caster is Engaged in Melee or Ran this turn, Casting a Spell is more difficult. Add +2 to the difficulty of the Cast Check in either of these cases. A roll of 20 on a Cast Check will always be successful, even if the difficulty would be higher than 20.

## Ongoing Spells

There are a certain type of spells known as 'Ongoing Spells'. These spells remain in effect once Cast, but a Morale Check is required at the start of each of the caster's player's turns. If it fails, the spell ends, otherwise it remains in effect.

The caster cannot have multiple instances of the same Ongoing Spell in effect at the same time, but can have different Ongoing Spells in effect at the same time.

If the Caster is Stunned or Incapacitated, the Ongoing Spell immediately ends.

## Casting and Equipment

### Casting and Armour
Units cannot Cast Spells if they are wearing Armour (including Shields). The exception to this are Units that Cast Prayers, a specific type of Spell. In this case, a unit can freely Cast Prayers while wearing Armour.

### Casting and Weapons
The ability to Cast Spells requires a Spellbook. This takes up a single slot of Melee equipment, meaning a Hero that can cast Spells can only use a single-handed Melee Weapon. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the cost of the Spellbook is included in the cost of the unit.

Again, units that Cast Prayers do not require a Spellbook, instead drawing on divine power to enable them to Cast Prayers.

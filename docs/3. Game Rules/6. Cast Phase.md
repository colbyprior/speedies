# Cast Phase

## Spellcasting
You may cast spells during the shooting and spellcasting phase. Spellcasting is not subjected to the same rules as shooting for picking targets.

To cast a spell roll equal to or higher than the difficulty of the spell. Depending on the spell, how well you rolled to cast the spell may be relevant.

## Spellcasting modifiers
When engaged in melee combat, running or charging casting a spell is more difficult. Add a +2 to the difficulty of the spell in any of these cases.

## Armour and spellcasting
Only units that cast prayers may equip armour or a shield.

<!--
- Units that are Engaged in melee combat may not shoot
- Units that have Run this turn may not shoot
- Units that are stunned or dazed may not shoot or cast spells
- Spellcasting may still be performed even in melee or after running with +2 difficulty

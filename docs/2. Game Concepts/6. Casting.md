Spellcasters fall into one of two categories, Arcane or Divine. No matter the type of spellcaster, they can choose one spell from the relevant spell list to learn upon being hired.
#### Arcane Spellcasters

Arcane Spellcasters have the following special rules:
* They have an innate 'Basic' spell that is always castable and is in addition to other spells learnt
* They only have a single weapon slot, which must be a melee weapon
* They cannot use armour or a shield

#### Divine Spellcasters

Divine Spellcasters have the following special rules:
* They have the usual three weapon slots
* They can use armour and shields as normal

# Equipment

:::danger[Actively Being Updated]
This section will change prior to the start of alpha playtesting.
:::

Units can equip a variety of equipment before a game.

## Unit Types & Equipment

Heroes have a total of three weapon slots, two Melee Weapon slots and one Ranged Weapon slot. Henchman meanwhile, have one Melee Weapon slot and a second slot that is flexible, working as either a second Melee Weapon slot or as a Ranged Weapon slot.


## Melee Weapons

Melee weapons work similarly to Ranged Weapons. Obviously, they do not have a Range, but their Pierce and Injury stats work the same way as for Ranged Weapons. In addition, they may have Melee modifiers, which lower the required roll for a Melee Check.

For example, if a Warrior with Melee 14 attacks with a Spear, which has a Melee modifier of +2, the Warrior only needs to roll a 12 or higher to pass a Melee Check. It's important to note that this does not improve the roll for the purposes of Injury (ie. it is the opposite to the Injury modifier).

Unlike Ranged Weapons, Melee Weapons can take up multiple weapon slots (eg. two-handed weapons). A unit may have no more than two weapon slots worth of Melee Weapons (including shields).

### Dual-Wielding

If a unit only has one Melee Weapon (not including shields), that weapon is used for all Melee Attacks. If a unit has two Melee Weapons, it is considered to be 'Dual-Wielding'. In this case, it receives an additional Attack in Melee Combat. Each weapon must be used to make at least one attack each turn in Melee Combat, but a unit's Melee Attacks can otherwise be split any way between the two weapons.



## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons have a few attributes, as described below. These inform players on how to best use each Ranged Weapon. In addition, Ranged Weapons may have some specific special rules. A unit may have no more than one Ranged Weapon.

### Range

This describes the maximum distance between a unit and the enemy it is targeting. If the target of your Ranged Attack is further away than this distance, the attack automatically misses. If Range also impacts whether you may have Advantage during Ranged Checks. See Being Elevated for more details.

### Piercing

As described elsewhere, a weapon that has Piercing reduces the enemy's Defence by an equivalent amount when attacked by that weapon.

For example, a Pistol with Piercing +3 is used to Shoot at a Sellsword Warrior with a Shield, which has Defence 15. The Pistol reduces the Warrior's Defence to 18 during the Shot.

### Injury Modifier

As described elsewhere, a Ranged Weapon that has an Injury Modifier increases the value of a Ranged Check (or Melee Check if a Melee Weapon is being used in Melee) for the purposes of Injury, but not for the purpose of hitting the target.

For example, if a Sellsword Archer with Ranged 14 uses a Crossbow (Injury +2), they still need to roll a 14 or higher during their Ranged Check to hit. If that Archer did roll a 14 and the target failed their Defence Check, the Check would instead count as a 16 for the purposes of Injury. This means that the target would be Stunned instead of Dazed.

### Reloading Special Rules

In addition to other attributes, Ranged Weapons may have some other special rules. Two of the most common ones pertain to when they can be Reloaded. A Ranged Weapon begins the game Reloaded and, unless described otherwise, is automatically Reloaded between turns. A Ranged Weapon that is not Reloaded cannot be used to attack. The Special Rules around Reloading are described below.

<!--
JP 27-10-25: Removing the following, now that we are looking at removing this special rule.
#### Stand and Reload

Some weapons are too difficult to Reload while Moving. Stand and Reload requires a unit to forego Moving for a turn to Reload. A weapon that has this property starts the game Loaded. Once used to attack, the unit must not Move during a future Move Phase before the weapon can be used to Shoot again. A unit can forego its Move in a Move Phase and then immediately Shoot using the weapon in the Shoot Phase of the same turn.
-->
#### Long Reload

Some weapons (usually Blackpowder Weapons) require a series of steps to Reload and so take some time between shots. For this reason, a Load Reload weapon cannot be used to Shoot if it was used to Shoot in the previous turn.






## Other Equipment

Besides weapons, there are a few other types of equipment that units can use.

### Armour

All units have one Armour slot, allowing them to wear armour that provides a bonus to their Defence. Shields are considered Melee Weapons, rather than Armour for the purposes of occupying slots.

### Consumables

Heroes can equip one Consumable. Consumables are one-time-use items that have a wide variety of effects. Potions are the most common type of Consumable, ranging from Healing Potions to Potions of Invisibility.
### Magic Items

Magic Items are some of the best pieces of equipment in the game. They can be any equipment type (Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, or Armour), or may not take up any of these slots at all (such as a cape or pair of boots). Like Consumables, heroes can equip one Magic Item at a time.

# Special Scenarios

:::danger[Actively Being Updated]
This section will change prior to the start of alpha playtesting.
:::

Special Scenarios represent milestones within a campaign. A campaign generally has 1-3 rounds of Special Scenarios. For each player, there will always be 1 Special Scenario for the campaign finale, plus 1-2 Special Scenarios spaced evenly throughout the rest of the campaign.

As the final part of campaign creation, Special Scenarios need to be determined. This is done via the following steps:




## Special Scenarios Campaign Setup

At the start of the campaign, the group should decide on what Special Scenarios will be played during the campaign. They should do this collectively, deciding on enough Special Scenarios to cover all of the Special Scenario games to be played during the campaign.

Special Scenarios are in four types

* Law vs Chaos
* Chaos vs Underworld
* Underworld vs Law
* All Factions

These types represent which Factions will partake in each scenario. So a 'Law vs Chaos' Special Scenario will be fought by one Law Faction warband and one Chaos Faction warband. For 'All Factions' Special Scenarios, this represents a Scenario that is played by three players, with one from each Faction. This is generally for handling uneven player counts.

As the final step in campaign creation, the group needs to determine the Special Scenarios for the campaign. To do so, do the following:

1. Determine the required number of Special Scenarios of each type for a single round
2. Multiply this by the number of rounds of Special Scenarios
3. Choose the specific Special Scenarios to fulfill the requirements

### Special Scenario Type Requirements

This section will describe how many of each Special Scenario type is required for a round of Special Scenarios during the campaign. To do so, refer to the table below. To use the table, look at the row corresponding to the total number of players in your group. 

Example: If you have 5 Players, refer to the row with Total Players equal to 5.

Now, order the assign the Factions to A, B, and C based on how many players are in each faction. Faction A should have the most players and Faction C should have the least.

Example: If your 5 Player group has 1 Law Player, 2 Chaos Players, and 2 Underworld Players, assign Faction A to Chaos, Faction B to Underworld and Faction C to Law.

At this point you can determine the structure of the exact games.

Example: Following above, this means there would be 1 'All Factions' Special Scenario and 1 Chaos vs Underworld Special Scenario.

#### Special Scenario Table

| Total Players | Faction A | Faction B | Faction C | A vs B | B vs C | C vs A | All Factions | Total Matches |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| 2             | 1         | 1         | 0         | 1      | 0      | 0      | 0            | 1             |
| 3             | 1         | 1         | 1         | 0      | 0      | 0      | 1            | 1             |
| 4             | 2         | 1         | 1         | 1      | 0      | 1      | 0            | 2             |
| 5             | 2         | 2         | 1         | 1      | 0      | 0      | 1            | 2             |
| 6             | 2         | 2         | 2         | 1      | 1      | 1      | 0            | 3             |
| 7             | 3         | 2         | 2         | 1      | 1      | 0      | 1            | 3             |
| 8             | 3         | 3         | 2         | 2      | 1      | 1      | 0            | 4             |
4-player rule: If Faction B or C are higher in Wins than both Faction A players, they can choose their Faction A opponent.

For higher player counts, simply use as many 6 player groupings as possible and then refer to the appropriate row for the number of remaining players.

For example, for 10 players you would combine the 6 player and 4 player rows (but don't use the special 4-player rule above). So there would be 2 A vs B games, 1 B vs C game and 2 C vs A games.


### Multiply Special Scenario Requirements

The next step is to multiply the number of Special Scenarios required for a single round by the total number of rounds of Special Scenarios in the campaign. A Standard Length 6-player campaign has the following structure:

| Round | Description                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-5   | Play against each other player once |
| 6     | Mid-campaign Special Scenario       |
| 7-11  | Play against each other player once |
| 12    | Special Scenario finale             |
In it, there are two Special Scenario rounds (Rounds 6 and 12). Referring to the Special Scenario table, we can see that the we need one each of the Law vs Chaos, Chaos vs Underworld, and Underworld vs Law Special Scenarios to complete a round.

This means we simply multiply this by the two rounds of Special Scenarios so we will need:

* 2 Law vs Chaos Special Scenarios
* 2 Chaos vs Underworld Special Scenarios
* 2 Underworld vs Law Special Scenarios

### Select Campaign Special Scenarios

The final step required is to take the number of Special Scenarios required above and actually pick the Special Scenarios that will be played. This should be done collaboratively with the group, picking Special Scenarios that will allow all players to meet their goals, where possible.

When you select Special Scenarios, choose which specific round each one will belong to, so that everyone knows ahead of time. This will help provide a general structure for the campaign, although the group may not yet know who will play which scenario at larger player counts.

Once this is done, campaign creation is complete and the group can begin playing their first games!

## Playing Special Scenarios

When it comes time to actually play a Special Scenario, players need to determine which Special Scenario they will play and who they will play it against. Those that have more wins across the campaign


hich players play which Special Scenarios needs to be determined. For lower player counts, certain players may only have a single choice, but for higher player counts well-performing players have the ability to influence their opponents.

Should there be a number of options available

### Special Scenario Rules

The exact details of the Special Scenarios are listed in the Special Scenarios List. There are however some rules that apply to all Special Scenarios.

#### Routing

Due to the important nature of these scenarios, a warband's rout threshold is increased by 2. In addition, there may be other ways to force your opponent to make rout checks via special objectives. These will be described within the Special Scenario.

#### Faction Support

Everyone gets 50g of Faction Support to spend.

As usual, there is a cap of 4 Faction Units per warband.

## Buying Hero Slots

Players can spend gold to increase their total Hero Slots and enable them to hire Heroes beyond the usual 3. This can be especially useful if the player has gotten unlucky with Henchman Promotion roles. See the following table for the cost required to by a Hero slot. The costs listed are not cumulative.

| Hero Slot | Cost |
| --------- | ---- |
| 4th       | 50g  |
| 5th       | 100g |
| 6th       | 150g |
## Buying Improvement Attempts

Players can spend 25g to allow a Hero to make an Improvement Attempt. Draw once from the Improvement Deck for that Hero and resolve the card. Each Hero can only attempt to Improve once between each game.

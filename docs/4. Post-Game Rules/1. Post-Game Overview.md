# Post-Game Overview

After the game is over, the post-game phase begins. Each player performs the following steps in order:

1. Update Wins/Losses on Warband Sheet
2. Roll for Income & Loot
3. Resolve Promotions
4. Roll for Injury & the Plague
5. Each hero makes an Improvement Attempt
6. Learn Skills & Spells
7. Spend Gold

Units can also be Retired at any point during the post-game phase.

The post-game phase can be done at each player's own pace, as long as the post-game phase is completed prior to the next game. Ideally, steps 1-5 are done in-person as they don't require player decisions and are handled via dice rolls.

### Stat Caps

All units have Stat Caps as per the table below. Should a hero need to make a check to Improve a stat that is already at the Stat Cap, draw another card from the ??? Deck instead.

If a unit's Melee **or** Ranged is at the Stat Cap, the player has the choice to either attempt to Improve the stat not at the Stat Cap, or draw again from the ??? Deck.

| Stat        | Max/Min | Cap |
| ----------- | ------- | --- |
| Skill/Spell | Max     | 3   |
| W           | Max     | 3   |
| A           | Max     | 3   |
| Prc         | Max     | 5   |
| Inj         | Max     | 5   |
| Def         | Min     | 5   |
| Mel         | Min     | 5   |
| Rng         | Min     | 5   |
| Agi         | Min     | 5   |
| Mrl         | Min     | 5   |

The cap of 3 Skills or Spells does not include any Skills or Special Rules that the hero starts with, but does include the Spell learnt by Spellcasters when hired.

## Spell Advancement

If a Spellcaster is able to a learn a new Skill or Spell, choose which. If a Skill is chosen, resolve it as normal. Remember though, that learning a Skill will count towards the Cap and lower the total Spells the Spellcaster will be able to learn by one.

If a Spell is chosen, choose a Spell from the Spell list that the Spellcaster does not yet know. It learns the Spell. After learning a new Spell, lower the Spell DCs of all previous Spells (not including the spell just learnt) by 1.

If a Spellcaster always attempts to learn a new Spell, they will be able to get a total of 3 of the 4 Spells available to them. The first Spell learnt will have its DC lowered by 2 and the second Spell learnt will have its DC lowered by 1.

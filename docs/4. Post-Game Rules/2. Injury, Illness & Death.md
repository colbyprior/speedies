## Henchmen Serious Injury

Roll a d20 when a henchmen suffers an injury after a game.

| d20  | Result                                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | This unit contracts the plague or dies if they already have the plague. |
| 2-5  | This unit is dead.                                                      |
| 6-20 | This unit makes a full recovery.                                        |
## The Plauge
Units can contract the plague when suffering injury. Units with the plague will gain advantage on the first round of melee attack rolls.

### Plague progression roll
When a unit has the plague they must check if the Plague progresses after each game. Heroes make this roll with advantage.

| d20   | Result                    |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 1-7   | This unit dies.           |
| 8-18  | Nothing happens.          |
| 19-20 | Recovers from the plague. |

### Spreading the plague
If a unit is incapacitated by a unit with the plague in melee, they must make a morale check. If they fail the morale check, they immediately contract the plague.

If the unit that was incapacitated already had the plague then nothing happens.

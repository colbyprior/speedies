## The Plague
Units can contract the Plague when Incapacitated. Units with the plague gain Advantage on Melee Checks during the turn of any new combat.

### Plague progression roll
When a unit has the Plague they must check if the Plague progresses after each game. Heroes make this roll with Advantage.

| d20   | Result                   |
| ----- | ------------------------ |

| 8-18  | Nothing happens          |
| 19-20 | Recovers from the Plague |

### Spreading the plague
If a unit Incapacitates or is Incapacitated by a unit with the Plague in Melee, they must make a Morale Check. If it fails, they immediately contract the Plague.

If the unit that was incapacitated already has the Plague then nothing happens.

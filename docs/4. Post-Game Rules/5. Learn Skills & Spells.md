## Learning Spells

If a Spellcaster is able to a learn a new Skill or Spell, choose which. If a Skill is chosen, resolve it as normal. Remember though, that learning a Skill will count towards the Cap and lower the total Spells the Spellcaster will be able to learn by one.

If a Spell is chosen, choose a Spell from the Spell list that the Spellcaster does not yet know. It learns the Spell. After learning a new Spell, lower the Cast Checks of all previous Spells (not including the spell just learnt) by 1.

If a Spellcaster always attempts to learn a new Spell, they will be able to get a total of 3 of the 4 Spells available to them. The first Spell learnt will have its Cast Checks lowered by 2 and the second Spell learnt will have its Cast Checks lowered by 1.

# Improvement

Whenever a unit Incapacitates an opponent, that unit makes an Improvement check. First, pull from the Improvement Deck to see what happens.

For a hero, check the 'Hero' half of the card. It will denote which stat will Improve. You may need to make a stat check for it to Improve.

For a henchman, check the 'Henchman' half of the card. It will usually be blank, but some cards will show the following:

* Promote if the Incapacitated unit is a Leader! (3 cards)
* Promote if the Incapacitated unit is a Hero! (2 cards)
* Promote! (1 card)

If the unit meets the condition, it will Promote at the end of the battle! It does not draw any additional cards from the Improvement Deck for the rest of the battle.

Once a card is drawn, discard it. It's recommended to place it under the Incapacitated unit, to help remember whether players have drawn the correct number of times from the Improvement Deck.

In the event that the deck runs out of cards, gather up the discarded cards and shuffle them together to form a new deck.

At the end of the game, each Hero will draw once from the Improvement Deck for free, provided they did not die.
## Hero stat ups

The following shows an alternate method for checking Hero stat ups via rolling a d20.

| d20   | Result      | Extra                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20    | W           |                                                                                                          |
| 19    | A           |                                                                                                          |
| 18    | Prc         |                                                                                                          |
| 17    | Inj         |                                                                                                          |
| 14-16 | Skill/Spell |                                                                                                          |
| 12-13 | Def         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |
| 7-11  | Mel/Rng     | Pick which stat to attempt to improve. You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill |
| 4-6   | Agi         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |
| 1-3   | Mrl         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |


### Stat Caps

All units have Stat Caps as per the table below. Should a hero need to make a check to Improve a stat that is already at the Stat Cap, draw another card from the Improvement Deck instead.

If a unit's Melee **or** Ranged is at the Stat Cap, the player has the choice to either attempt to Improve the stat not at the Stat Cap, or draw again from the Improvement Deck.

| Stat        | Max/Min | Cap |
| ----------- | ------- | --- |
| Skill/Spell | Max     | 3   |
| W           | Max     | 3   |
| A           | Max     | 3   |
| Prc         | Max     | 5   |
| Inj         | Max     | 5   |
| Def         | Min     | 5   |
| Mel         | Min     | 5   |
| Rng         | Min     | 5   |
| Agi         | Min     | 5   |
| Mrl         | Min     | 5   |

The cap of 3 Skills or Spells does not include any Skills or Special Rules that the hero starts with, but does include the Spell learnt by Spellcasters when hired.

## Spell Improvement

If a Spellcaster is able to a learn a new Skill or Spell, choose which. If a Skill is chosen, resolve it as normal. Remember though, that learning a Skill will count towards the Cap and lower the total Spells the Spellcaster will be able to learn by one.

If a Spell is chosen, choose a Spell from the Spell list that the Spellcaster does not yet know. It learns the Spell. After learning a new Spell, lower the Spell DCs of all previous Spells (not including the spell just learnt) by 1.

If a Spellcaster always attempts to learn a new Spell, they will be able to get a total of 3 of the 4 Spells available to them. The first Spell learnt will have its DC lowered by 2 and the second Spell learnt will have its DC lowered by 1.

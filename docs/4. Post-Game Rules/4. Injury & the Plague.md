# Injury & the Plague

After each game, any unit that was Incapacitated during that game must roll for Serious Injuries. Heroes and henchman roll on separate tables, reflecting a hero's ability to overcome wounds that would kill a regular person.

Roll on the appropriate table below and consult the result. Some results have permanent effects. Adjust the stats of the unit, or add a new Special Rule as appropriate. Stats can be lowered by the same result multiple times.

| 16  | Pit Fight!         | Pit Fight (see below)                                                           |
| 17  | Berserk            | This unit gains the Berserker special rule                                      |

| 20  | Improvement        | This unit immediately makes an Improvement Attempt with Advantage               |

### Deathtouched

A hero that sustains a Serious Injury may become Deathtouched. When this happens, the 'Deathtouched' checkbox is checked on the warband sheet for the relevant hero. The hero is now close to death and an additional 'Deathtouched' result on the Serious Injuries table will result in the hero dying.
### Pit Fight

If a hero rolls 'Pit Fight!', that hero is forced to take part in a Pit Fight against its will, with freedom on the line. The hero faces off in single combat with the 'Pit Fighter' Faction Agent. Have another player control the Pit Fighter for the duration of this battle. Both units start 2" away from each other. Roll randomly to see who goes first and then begin the fight. The battle continues until either side is Incapacitated.

If the hero wins, it gains an Improvement Attempt and gains 50g for its warband. If the hero loses, that hero becomes the Pit Fighter. The old Pit Fighter is released and returns to its warband (if it has one). If that increases the warband beyond its Hero Slots cap, increase the cap by 1. If this would increase the warband beyond 6 slots, an existing Hero must retire, otherwise the Pit Fighter will not rejoin the warband. The old Pit Fighter retains the 'Pit Fighter' skill.

The new Pit Fighter is immediately removed from the warband's roster and its stats are added to the Pit Fighter card. It gains the 'Pit Fighter' skill.

## Henchmen Serious Injuries

| d20  | Result                                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | This unit contracts the Plague or dies if they already have the Plague. |
| 2-5  | Death                                                                   |
| 6-20 | Nothing happens                                                         |


## The Plague

Units can contract the Plague incidentally when Incapacitated, or from being in contact with someone that has the Plague. The Plague is known to be spread via blood, so battles between warbands is a common way for the Plague to spread. Allies with the Plague are generally kept at a distance, preventing the spread within warbands.
### Plague Roll

Units that have the Plague must roll at the end of every game to see how the Plague progresses. Heroes added a +2 Modifier to this roll.

| d20   | Result                  |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4   | Death                   |
| 8-18  | Nothing happens         |
| 16-20 | Recover from the Plague |

### Plague Effects

The Plague has the following effects during battle:

1. Units with the plague gain Advantage on Melee Checks during the turn of any new combat.
2. If a unit Incapacitates or is Incapacitated by a unit with the Plague in Melee, they must make a Morale Check. If it fails, they immediately contract the Plague.
	1. If the unit that was Incapacitated already has the Plague then nothing happens.

## Death

When a unit dies (usually via Serious Injuries or the Plague), the following happens:
* Immediately remove that unit from your warband sheet
* Lose any equipment that the unit had

Note that this does not impact the number of hero slots you have. For example, if you have five hero slots and lose one of your five heroes, the number of hero slots remains at five.


### Death of a Leader

In the unfortunate event that your Leader dies, select one of your other heroes. They gain the 'Leader' skill and are treated as the Leader for the purpose of rules from now on. You may re-buy the dead hero type in the future (up to the cap of one), but such a unit will not have the 'Leader' skill upon purchase and is not considered the Leader of the warband for Rout Checks.

For example, a Sellsword warband's Captain dies. A player chooses one of their Champions to become the Leader as that Champion has high Morale. The player adds the 'Leader' skill to the Champion. They have enough gold to purchase a new 'Captain'. They do so, but that Captain does not have the 'Leader' skill and is not treated as the Leader for the purposes of rules.

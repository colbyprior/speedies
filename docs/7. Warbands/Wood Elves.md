## Nature Spells 

| Name | Check | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Invisibility | 12 | Choose one unit within 6", which can be the caster. On a success, that unit cannot be targeted by Shooting or Engages until the spell ends. If the unit is in combat, it moves 1" out of combat. If the unit Engages, casts a spell, or makes a Ranged attack, the spell ends. At the start of each of the player's turns, the caster must make a Morale check to keep the spell going. Only one unit can be affected by this spell at a time. LB. This does not block opponent run, movement, or contest treasure. LB. Ends if Wizard is stunned or OoA. |
| Overgrowth | 9 | Choose a point within 12". Place a piece of natural terrain (eg. woods) centred at that point. The terrain cannot be longer or wider than 3", or taller than 5". Some leniency should be made if it fits the spirit of the spell. LB. The terrain must fit within the space (ie. other terrain cannot be moved to accommodate it). If a unit is able to move through the terrain at all, it counts as Difficult Terrain. LB. Only one such piece of terrain can exist at a time. If the spell is successfully recast, the existing piece of terrain disappears, then the new piece of terrain is created. |
| Root | 11 | Choose one unit within 20". That unit cannot Engage, Move, Run, or Disengage until the start of your next turn. |

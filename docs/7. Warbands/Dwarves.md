# Dwarves
These chonkers go bonkers.

| Max Units  | 12              |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Play Style | Rough and Tough |

## Special Rules
### Hard to Kill
Dwarves have a -2 to Injury rolls made against them (eg. an unmodified roll of 19 would count as a 17, Stunning rather than Incapaciating the Dwarf).
### Sturdy Legs
Wearing Armour does not reduce a Dwarf's Move attribute.
### Ranged Shields
Dwarf gunners may use any ranged weapon with a shield.

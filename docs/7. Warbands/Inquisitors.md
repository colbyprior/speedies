| Steadfast | 12 | Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear. In addition, the whole warband gains +2 on any Morale tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, ie, the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +2. |

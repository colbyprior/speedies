Welcome to Blightmeer! Blightmeer is a grimdark fantasy skirmish wargame set in the city of 'Blightmeer'. Inspired by classic skirmish games, it aims to retain their narrative spirit, while feeling fresher and more streamlined. A typical two-player game takes roughly an hour from deployment to routing and uses a d20 system. Turns are quick, with the game getting to the climax of a battle quickly.

In the spirit of narrative play, the recommended way to experience Blightmeer is by playing a campaign with a group. During this, players battle it out in a series of games, with Factions and the quarantined city of Blightmeer providing a backdrop for the action.

This rulebook provides all of the necessary information to run countless battles and campaigns in Blightmeer with your friends. Create a warband and enter the city of wealth and ruin!

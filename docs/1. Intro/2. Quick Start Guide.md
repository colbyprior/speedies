# Quick Start Guide

To get started as quickly as possible, we recommend doing the following:

1. Read the Blightmeer Overview if you haven't already
2. Read the General Wargaming section if you are unfamiliar with wargames
3. Read the Game Concepts section
4. Read the Game Rules

At this point, you can begin playing an actual game! We recommend taking two of the Sample Warbands and playing a game. Sellswords and Dwarves are the simplest, but you are welcome to try any warband. Print out the warbands, as well as the Quick Reference guide (which you can refer to during the game).

When playing your first game, set up by following the Map Setup and Deployment section. Finally, read through 'The First Turn' and you are ready to dive in!

Immediately after your first game, you can run through the Post-Game Rules as if it was a real campaign game, to get a sense of what it would be like. After that, you can read any sections you have not yet read and peruse the warbands, now that you have a better understand of what everything means. 

You should now be ready to begin a full campaign, the recommended way to experience the game!

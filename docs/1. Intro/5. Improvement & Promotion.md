# Improvement & Promotion

***This section needs a new home!***

Whenever a unit Incapacitates an opponent, that unit draws from the Improvement Deck to see what happens. The outcomes are different depending on whether the unit is a hero or a henchman.


## Hero Improvement

For a hero, check the 'Hero' half of the card. It will denote which stat will Improve. You may need to make a stat check for it to Improve.

If you succeed on the roll (or if there is no roll required), improve that stat by 1 immediately.

* Wound, Attack, Pierce, and Injure all increase by 1
* Melee, Ranged, Defense, Agility, and Morale all decrease by 1

If you drew a card that denotes 'Skill/Spell', that hero can learn a new Skill (or Spell if it's a caster). Note it down. At the end of the game, select a new Skill or Spell for that hero when updating your warband. See the relevant sections for more details.

### Hero Improvement Table

The following shows an alternate method for checking Hero stat ups via rolling a d20.

| d20   | Result      | Extra                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20    | W           |                                                                                                          |
| 19    | A           |                                                                                                          |
| 18    | Prc         |                                                                                                          |
| 17    | Inj         |                                                                                                          |
| 14-16 | Skill/Spell |                                                                                                          |
| 12-13 | Def         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |
| 7-11  | Mel/Rng     | Pick which stat to attempt to improve. You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill |
| 4-6   | Agi         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |
| 1-3   | Mrl         | You need to roll equal to or under in order to improve this skill                                        |

### Hero Stat Caps

All units have Stat Caps as per the table below and cannot improve past it under any circumstances. Should a hero need to make a check to Improve a stat that is already at the Stat Cap, draw another card from the Improvement Deck instead.

If a unit's Melee **or** Ranged is at the Stat Cap, the player has the choice to either attempt to Improve the stat not at the Stat Cap, or draw again from the Improvement Deck.

| Stat        | Max/Min | Cap |
| ----------- | ------- | --- |
| Skill/Spell | Max     | 3   |
| W           | Max     | 3   |
| A           | Max     | 3   |
| Prc         | Max     | 5   |
| Inj         | Max     | 5   |
| Def         | Min     | 5   |
| Mel         | Min     | 5   |
| Rng         | Min     | 5   |
| Agi         | Min     | 5   |
| Mrl         | Min     | 5   |

The cap of 3 Skills or Spells does not include any Skills or Special Rules that the hero starts with, but does include the Spell learnt by Spellcasters when hired.


## Henchman Promotion

For a henchman, check the 'Henchman' half of the card. It will usually be blank, but some cards will show the following:

* Promote if the Incapacitated unit is a Leader! (3 cards)
* Promote if the Incapacitated unit is a Hero! (2 cards)
* Promote! (1 card)

If the unit meets the condition, it will Promote at the end of the battle! It does not draw any additional cards from the Improvement Deck for the rest of the battle.


## Discarding Improvement Cards

Once a card is drawn and resolved, discard it. It's recommended to place it under the Incapacitated unit, to help remember whether players have drawn the correct number of times from the Improvement Deck.

In the event that the deck runs out of cards, gather up the discarded cards and shuffle them together to form a new deck.

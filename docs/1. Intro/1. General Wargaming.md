# General Wargaming

<!--
Terminology to decide on:

1. Attribute vs Statistic vs Characteristic for Move, Melee, Def etc. -> Attribute
2. Changing 'Charge' to 'Engage' -> Yes
3. Changing 'Knocked Down' to 'Dazed' -> Yes
4. 'Staggered'? -> Yes
5. Changing 'Diving Charge' to something else (Dive, Diving Engage, Dive Bomb???) -> Jump Attack
6. All phase names
7. 'Check 'for attribute checks (where you need to above a stat)?
8. Changing 'Random Happening' to 'Event'? -> Yes (maybe faction event or special event instead)
9. 'Roll' for other rolls that don't rely on attributes (Event, Out of Sight)
10. Changing 'Rout' to 'Retreat'? (I actually prefer Rout). -> Keep Rout
11. 'Unit', 'Warrior' or something else? -> Unit

Style guide decisions:
Hyphenation? Line of Sight, Out of Sight OR Line-of-Sight, Out-of-Sight?
Headings capitalisation 'Melee Phase' or 'Melee phase'? Capitalise joining words? 'Scenario and Deployment' or 'Scenario And Deployment'?
We should capitalise (and also hyperlink) any keywords (Check, Move, Dazed etc. etc.)
Australian English

JP 23-03-25: To playtest:
1. Big guys
2. New disengage rules (Agi check to disengage)
3. Staggered causes the unit to have disadvantage on any checks until the end of their turn
4. Fall/Jump down/Climb down changes
5. Fear causes disadvantage

Undead vs Ratlings 700g each

+3 Attribute means lower that attribute by that much

+3 Inj means increase the Injury modifier of the attack roll by that much

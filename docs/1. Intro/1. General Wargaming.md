# General Wargaming

## Objective
The objective of a wargame scenario varies depending on the mission or narrative, but generally, players aim to eliminate enemy models, control key objectives, or complete mission-specific tasks. Victory is achieved by fulfilling the scenario’s win conditions, often through strategic positioning, clever use of terrain, and effective combat.

## What You Need

### Tabletop
A 3'x3' game board is ideal. The setting is a dense, ruined city filled with multi-level buildings, rubble, and other obstacles. Include a variety of terrain features such as ladders, bridges, overpasses, and broken walls to create verticality and tight line-of-sight zones.

### Miniatures
Each player will command a warband consisting of 6 to 18 models. These can be miniatures from any line or custom-made figures. Ensure models are mounted on bases of a consistent size and clearly represent their unit type.

### Tape Measure
A tape measure marked in inches is required for all measurements, including movement, range, and line-of-sight. Most in-game distances are measured in whole inches with some exceptions requiring half inches.

### Dice
This system exclusively uses a 20-sided die (d20). Each player will need at least one d20, but more can speed up play.

### Terrain
Lots of terrain is essential. Include ruined buildings, ladders, bridges, crates, and any other elements that reinforce the tight, vertical nature of a war-torn urban battlefield. Line-of-sight should be frequently blocked or obscured.

### Warband Sheets
Each player should have a Warband Sheet listing their models, stats, equipment, and abilities. This acts as your quick reference during play. This will be used to track the ongoing progress of your warband across multiple games. Record experience, injuries, upgrades, loot, and narrative events.

## Wargaming Concepts

### Measuring

#### How to Measure
Use a tape measure to determine distances in inches from a model’s base. Measure from the closest edge of the base unless otherwise specified.

#### When to Measure
Players may measure at any time except when it would give away information that should be kept hidden (e.g., checking range before declaring an attack). Otherwise, open measurement is encouraged for smooth gameplay.

### Moving
Each model has a Movement value (e.g., 5”). A model may move up to this distance in a straight or curved path, climbing or jumping as appropriate. Models may move through friendly units but not through enemies or impassable terrain. Vertical movement (e.g., climbing a ladder) uses the same Movement value and may require a Check for risky maneuvers.

### Engaging in Melee Combat
A model is considered Engaged if its base is touching the base of an enemy model. Melee attacks may only be made while Engaged. Engaged models may not move freely and must make a Disengage Check to leave melee range safely.

### Making Checks
Any action with an uncertain outcome (e.g., jumping gaps, climbing unstable surfaces, Disengaging) requires a Check. Roll 1d20 and add the relevant stat (Agility, Strength, etc.). Beat or meet the skill check set by the units attribute or the spell to succeed.

### Attacking


### Line-of-Sight
A model has Line-of-Sight (LoS) to a target if you can draw an unobstructed line from its head or weapon to any part of the enemy model’s body. Partial cover applies if the line crosses terrain. Full cover may block LoS entirely or apply penalties to hit.

### Randomising Direction
You must determine a random direction, roll 1d20 on the board from the target point. The direction that the d20 is pointing up from when you read the number face up is the direction.

## Structure

### Deployment
Players roll off or follow scenario instructions to determine deployment order. Warbands are placed within a designated deployment zone, usually within 2” of the board edge. Terrain should already be agreed upon and set up prior.

### Rounds
The game is played in Rounds. Each Round consists of a Turn for each player.

### Turns
On their Turn, a player activates their models on relevant turn phases.

### Game End
The game ends when the scenario’s victory conditions are met—this may be after a set number of Rounds, when objectives are completed, or when one warband is routed or eliminated. A post-game phase follows for experience, injuries, and loot if playing a campaign.

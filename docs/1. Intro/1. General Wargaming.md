%%
Terminology to decide on:

1. Attribute vs Statistic vs Characteristic for Move, Melee, Def etc.
2. Changing 'Charge' to 'Engage'
3. Changing 'Knocked Down' to 'Dazed'
4. 'Staggered'?
5. Changing 'Diving Charge' to something else (Dive, Diving Engage, Dive Bomb???)
6. All phase names
7. 'Check 'for attribute checks (where you need to above a stat)?
8. Changing 'Random Happening' to 'Event'?
9. 'Roll' for other rolls that don't rely on attributes (Event, Out of Sight)
10. Changing 'Rout' to 'Retreat'? (I actually prefer Rout).
11. 'Unit', 'Warrior' or something else?

Style guide decisions:
Hyphenation? Line of Sight, Out of Sight OR Line-of-Sight, Out-of-Sight?
Headings capitalisation 'Melee Phase' or 'Melee phase'? Capitalise joining words? 'Scenario and Deployment' or 'Scenario And Deployment'?
We should capitalise (and also hyperlink) andykeywords (Check, Move, Dazed etc. etc.)

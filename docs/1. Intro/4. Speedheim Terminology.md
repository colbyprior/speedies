# Speedheim Terminology
## Characteristics
For checks, you now need to be equal to or greater than your stat to pass. So lower stats are better (besides Attacks, Wounds, and Piercing) and higher rolls are always better.

In Speedheim, each unit has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Movement       | How far a unit can move in inches under normal conditions.                                                                                                                      |
| Melee          | Roll equal to or higher in order to successfully attack in melee.                                                                                                               |
| Ranged         | Roll equal to or higher in order to successfully attack from ranged.                                                                                                            |
| Defence        | Roll equal to or higher in order to successfully prevent a unit from taking a wound.                                                                                            |
| Wounds         | Number of hits a unit can take before they are injured.                                                                                                                         |
| Agility        | Roll equal to or higher in order to successfully jump, climb and prevent falling damage. Agility also determines who can attack first in melee after the first round of combat. |
| Attacks        | The number of attacks the unit has in melee.                                                                                                                                    |
| Morale         | Roll equal to or higher in order to prevent your warband from succumbing to fear or routing when units are lost.                                                                |
| Piercing       | A modifier that affects enemy defence checks when attacking.                                                                                                                    |

### Advantage / Disadvantage
There is the concept of Advantage and Disadvantage. If you have Advantage on a check, you roll 2d20 and take the higher of the two values. If you have Disadvantage, you roll 2d20 and take the lower of the two values.

### Piercing modifiers
Every positive point of Piercing reduces the opponent’s Defence by 1. Every negative point of Piercing improves the opponent’s Defence by 1.

### Injury modifiers
A positive Injury modifier will increase the Melee/Ranged roll you made by that amount for the purposes of injury only (not whether you hit or not). Likewise, a negative Injury modifier will decrease the Melee/Ranged roll you made by that amount for the purposes of injury.

## Injury
Whenever someone is Injured, see the following table for the result. This is used for both melee combat, ranged combat, some spells and other checks like falling.

| Attack d20 Roll | Result                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1-11            | Dazed (or no effect in some cases) |
| 12-14           | Dazed                              |
| 15-17           | Stunned                            |
| 18-20           | Incapacitated                      |
### Falling damage
When falling, simply roll on the Injury chart. For every extra full inch above 2” that the unit falls from, add +2 to the Injury roll. A roll of 1-11 has no effect.

### Becoming Dazed or Stunned Next to a Ledge
A warrior that is dazed or stunned within 1” of an elevated edge must pass one Agility test or fall to the ground below, taking [falling damage](#falling-damage).
- Warriors will not fall off edges that have railings, low walls, etc. on all sides.

### Targeting units dazed or stunned in melee
You may only target a unit in melee when they are dazed or stunned if you are engaged with no other units that are able to fight back.

### Attacking a unit that is dazed or stunned
See the table below for resolving whether someone is put Incapacitated through Close Combat attacks on Stunned/Dazed:

| Status  | How To Incapacitate                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dazed   | Melee check with Advantage, Defence check as normal         |
| Stunned | Incapacitated automatically (but costs one attack to do so) |

### When a hero takes out any unit
Heroes that take out enemy units gain one experience point.

### When a henchmen takes out any unit
Immediately roll on the table below. If they succeed they will become a hero after this scenario. They retain their experience and immediately gain one level up. If they are Incapacitated this scenario roll on the hero injury chart instead of the henchmen injury chart.

| Henchmen OOA hero   | 18+ |
| ------------------- | --- |
| Henchmen OOA leader | 15+ |

#### What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)

Wargames have the concept of 'what you see is what you get'. This means that a unit's equipment is reflected by the model that represents it. So if a unit has a sword and shield, the model of the unit also has a sword and shield.

We heavily encourage adhering to WYSIWYG, where practical. Some reasonable exceptions are as follows:

- a ranged unit's melee weapon is not represented on the model
- only the melee or ranged weapons of a hero are represented on the model
- the model's weapon is not one that the unit can use
	- choose the closest equivalent as it's equipment instead
- any magic items that are acquired during the course of a campaign

If a unit's equipment could be swapped to make it closer to the model's equipment, a player should do so. So, if a model has a sword, then the unit should not have a spear equipped.

If people so wish, they can go as far as representing injuries, promotions to heroes, or magic items on their models. This is certainly not required however.

Ultimately, this is up to the group to decide how strictly they wish to adhere to this. The end goal should be to minimise confusion about a unit's equipment for others (and even yourself) and keeping on theme where possible.

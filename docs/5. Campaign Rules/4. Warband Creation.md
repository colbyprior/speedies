Arcane Spellcasters have the following special rules:
* They have an innate 'Basic' spell that is always castable and is in addition to other spells learnt
* They only have a single weapon slot, which must be a melee weapon
* They cannot use armour or a shield

#### Divine Spellcasters

Divine Spellcasters have the following special rules:
* They have the usual three weapon slots
* They can use armour and shields as normal

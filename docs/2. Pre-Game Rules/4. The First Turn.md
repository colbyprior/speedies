# The First Turn

At this point, the game can begin! Whoever deployed first also has the first turn. Consult the 'Game Rules' to learn how to play the game.

## First Turn Limitations

If you are going first you cannot do the following on your first turn (effectively skipping the relevant Phases/Steps):
* Pick up Treasure
* Engage
* Cast
* Shoot

This prevents situations where a player is not able to at least attempt to avoid Ranged Attacks and Engages from the opposing enemy.

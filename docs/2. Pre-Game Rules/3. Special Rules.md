## Underdog Bonus
Before starting a game each player counts how many overall game wins they have. The underdog will get 15g worth of faction support for every extra win that your opponent has.

eg. Jane has 4 wins and Bob only has 2 wins overall. Bob will get 30g worth of faction support for this game.

## Faction Support Gold
Faction agents can be purchased with faction support gold. This gold can only be spent on faction agents and if not spent, it is lost at the end of the battle.

#### Light 
This weapon may be used with a Shield.
#### Close Quarters 
Your target does not receive a bonus to their Defence if you Moved before Shooting this turn.
#### Long Reload 
You may not use this weapon if it was fired in the previous turn.
#### Dual-Wield 
You may purchase this weapon up to two times and wield both at once without using an additional weapon slot. If you do, you have Advantage on attacks with the weapon.
#### Blackpowder 
Whenever a 1 is rolled during a Ranged Attack, the weapon misfires. Immediately make an Injury Roll against yourself (applying the weapon's Injury modifier). You may no longer use the weapon for the rest of the game (resolving any remaining targets from the current attack first). After the game, it is repaired at no cost. If you have Advantage and either dice rolls a 1 you still misfire. If the higher roll still hits the enemy, resolve it as normal.

| Blight Madness | 13 | The caster may immediately Engage any enemy within 10" of movement, automatically passing any Agility Checks required. The caster gains 2 Attacks and +3 Injury until the end of this turn. |
| Ratpsychosis | 13 | All standing models in base contact with the rat must take an immediate Morale test. If they fail, you roll an attack against each target and they then run 5" directly away from the rat. |
| Curse of rat | 7 | The spell has a range of 10" and affects a single model within range. The target must re-roll any successful defence rolls and to melee rolls until the start of your next turn. |

| Lure | 12 | Basic. Target one unit you can see within 15". The target immediately moves towards the Caster by the most direct path, including by Jumping Down. If the target is able to reach the Caster, it is placed in base contact and the Caster is considered to have Engaged it. |
| Bat wings | 5 | Ongoing. Choose one ally within 5", including the caster. That unit gains the Flying skill. |
| Hex | 13 | Ongoing. Choose a single enemy within 10". The target has Disadvantage on all Checks it makes. |

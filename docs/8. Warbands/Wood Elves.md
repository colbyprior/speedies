## Skills 
### Leader
*Inherent*

Allied, non-animal units within 5" of this unit can use this unit's Morale stat for Checks instead of their own.
### Life Magic
*Spellcasting*

This unit is capable of casting Arcane Magic. See the relevant spell list for a list of learnable spells. As an Arcane Caster, this unit has an innate 'Basic' spell that is always castable and is in addition to other spells learnt. It also only has a single weapon slot which must be a melee weapon and is unable to use armour or a shield.
### Mark Target
*Inherent*

Once per Ranged Phase, instead of making a Ranged Attack, this unit may instead Mark an enemy unit within 10" (and within line-of-sight) until the start of the next turn. A unit that is Marked can be targeted by Ranged Attacks even when the unit is Engaged, but cannot be Protected from such Ranged Attacks.
### Follower
*Inherent*

This unit does not count for the purposes of a warband's max units.
### Animal
*Inherent*

This unit cannot Promote, use ladders (except by making a full Climb Check), pick up Treasure, benefit from the 'Leader' skill or use equipment (but is not penalised for fighting Unarmed).
### Fear
*Morale*

This unit causes Fear.
### Slow
*Inherent*

This unit may not Run, but may Engage as normal (ie. up to 1.5x of base Move).
### Large
*Inherent*

This unit may not be purchased at warband creation. It counts as two units for the purpose of Rout Checks. It cannot pick up Treasure. This unit is immune to the Blight. It cannot Promote.
### No Equipment
*Inherent*

This unit may not have any equipment, but does not suffer the penalties for fighting Unarmed.

| Invisibility | 12 | Ongoing. Choose one ally within 5" (including themselves). This unit is treated as no longer existing for the purposes of targeting or blocking Movement, line-of-sight or picking up Treasure. If it is Engaged, it is no longer Engaged and moves 1". If this unit Engages, casts a Spell, or makes a Ranged attack, the spell ends. |
| Control Earth | 10 | Choose a point within 10". Place a piece of natural terrain (a wood, mesa, etc.) at that point. The terrain cannot be larger than 3" in any dimension. Some leniency should be made if it fits the spirit of the spell. The terrain must fit within the space. If this is cast on a unit, move that unit to the closest space that it can be safely placed (this may be within or on the new terrain). |
| Root | 11 | Ongoing. Choose one unit within 20". That unit cannot Engage, Move, or Run. |
| Earthquake | 13 | All units within 10" must make an Agility check or become Dazed. |
| Magic Arrow | 12 | Basic. Cast Attack. Target one unit you can see within 30" and perform a Cast Attack. |

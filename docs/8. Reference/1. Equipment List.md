### Ranged Weapon Effects 
#### Blackpowder 
Whenever a 1 is rolled, the weapon misfires. Immediately roll an Injury to yourself (applying the weapon's Injury modifier). You may no longer use the weapon for the rest of the game. After the game, it is repaired at no cost. If you have Advantage and if either dice rolls a 1 you still misfire. If the higher roll still hits the enemy, resolve it as normal.
#### Long Reload 
You may only fire every other turn.
#### Close Quarters 
Your target does not receive a bonus to their Defense if you Moved before Shooting this turn.
#### Massive Shot 
Draw a 15" long and 1" wide line in any direction from the firer.
All models in its path are automatically hit but roll their defence as normal.
For any that fail, roll an Injury check +2 if they are reduced to 0 wounds.
#### Fire Once 
You may only fire this once per battle.
#### Dual Wield 
You may purchase this weapon up to two times and wield both at once without using an additional weapon slot. If you do, you have Advantage on attacks with the weapon.
#### Light 
This weapon may be used with a Shield.

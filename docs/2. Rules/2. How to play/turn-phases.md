# Turn Phases

To play, one side takes a turn, then the other side, then the original side and so on, much like in a game of draughts or chess. When it is your turn, you may move all your models, shoot with any warriors able to do so, and fight in hand-to-hand combat. Once your turn is complete, it is your opponentâ€™s turn to move, shoot and fight.

Turns are broken up into six phases:
1. Routing
2. Recovery & Pickup
3. Charging
4. Movement
5. Shooting & Spellcasting
6. Melee combat

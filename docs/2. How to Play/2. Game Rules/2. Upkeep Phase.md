# Routing phase
A player must make a Rout test at the start of his turn if a quarter (25%) or more of his warband is out of action. If the Rout test is failed, the warband automatically loses the fight. The game ends immediately and surviving warriors retreat from the area. 

To take a Rout test roll a d20. If the score is equal to or less than the warband leader’s Leadership, the player has passed the test and may continue to fight. If the warband’s leader is out of action or stunned, then the player may not use his Leadership to take the test. Instead, use the highest Leadership characteristic amongst any remaining fighters who are not stunned or out of action.

| No. of warriors in warband | No. of warriors knocked out of action before route checks |

| 13 - 16                    | 4                                                         |
| 17 - 18                    | 5                                                         |

## Voluntary rout
A player may choose to voluntarily Rout at the start of any of his own turns if they wish, but only if he was already required to take a Rout test or if a quarter (25%) or more of his warband are out of action.

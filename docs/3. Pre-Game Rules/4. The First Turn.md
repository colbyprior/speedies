# The First Turn

At this point, the game can begin! Whoever deployed first also has the first turn. Consult the 'Game Rules' to learn how to play the game.

## First Turn Limitations

If you are going first you cannot do the following on your first turn (effectively skipping the relevant Phases/Steps):
* Pick up Treasure
* Engage
* Cast spells
* Make Ranged Attacks

This prevents situations where a player is not able to at least attempt to avoid Ranged Attacks and Engages from the opposing enemy.

## Vanguard Units

Before the first turn, any units with the 'Vanguard' skill may make a Move or Run action. If both players have Vanguard units, the player that is going first will move their Vanguard units, followed by the other player.

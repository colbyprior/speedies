# Income & Loot

:::danger[Actively Being Updated]
This section will change prior to the start of alpha playtesting.
:::
## Income

At the end of the game, roll for income. To do so, do the following:

1. Check the number of Treasure token you obtained during the game
	1. Add an additional Treasure if you won the game
2. Roll a d20 for each Treasure token and add the values together
	1. Add 30g to the total value, which becomes your total gold earned
	2. For any 20s rolled on the d20, you earn additional 'Loot', described in the section below.
3. Update your warband sheet by adding your earned gold to any existing gold.

Some Treasure tokens may be worth double. In this case, roll an extra d20 for it during Step 2 above.
## Loot

When you roll a 20 during the Income rolls, you earn Loot! Loot comes in three forms, Rare Consumables, Rare Oddments, and Rare Armour & Weapons. Consumables are single-use items, while Rare Oddments, Armour and Weapons have ongoing effects. Oddments do not take up a weapon or armour slot, while Armour and Weapons do.

Only heroes can equip and use loot and can only have one Consumable and one Rare Oddment, Weapon, or Armour equipped at any one time. A hero can use any Rare Consumable, Oddment, Weapon, or Armour, unless they have explicit restrictions that prevent them from doing so (eg. Fixed Equipment special rules or they are an Arcane Caster). These heroes can still equip Oddments and Consumables, as usual.

To determine what loot you have received, first roll to see which table you are rolling on:

| d20   | Table                 |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1-12  | Rare Consumables      |
| 13-16 | Rare Oddments         |
| 17-20 | Rare Armour & Weapons |
Now roll on the relevant table, gaining the result and adding it to your stored equipment.

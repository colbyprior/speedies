# Learn Skills & Spells

If a hero has learnt a new Skill or Spell, the unit does the following:
## Learning a Skill

First, consult which skills can be learnt by the hero. In each warband's section, there is a table denoting which Skill Types they can learn. If the hero is a Promoted henchman, these learnable Skill Types will be listed under the Promotion Table instead.

Once you know which Skill Types the hero can learn, choose one Skill from among those Skill Types and add it as a Skill for that hero. Skills cannot be learnt by the same hero more than once.
## Learning a Spell

If the hero is a Caster, they can choose to learn a new Spell instead. This works similarly to Skills, except the Caster can choose a new spell from their relevant spell list instead.

JP 30-10-25: Below is out of date. Rewriting.

If a Caster is able to a learn a new Skill or Spell, choose which. If a Skill is chosen, resolve it as normal. Remember though, that learning a Skill will count towards the Cap and lower the total Spells the Caster will be able to learn by one.

If a Spell is chosen, choose a Spell from the Spell list that the Caster does not yet know. It learns the Spell. After learning a new Spell, lower the Cast Checks of all previous Spells (not including the spell just learnt) by 1.

If a Caster always attempts to learn a new Spell, they will be able to get a total of 3 of the 4 Spells available to them. The first Spell learnt will have its Cast Checks lowered by 2 and the second Spell learnt will have its Cast Checks lowered by 1.

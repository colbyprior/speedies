# Resolve Promotions

If a henchman Promoted during the previous battle, resolve it.

1. If this henchman's promotion would put you above six heroes, you must either immediately retire an existing hero otherwise the henchman does not Promote.
2. Remove the newly Promoted hero from the henchman slot they were in.
3. Add them to a spare hero slot, retaining their existing unit type. If they had the Blight before, they still have it, so mark that checkbox.
	1. If this puts you above the number of hero slots currently available to your warband, increase the number of hero slots this warband has by one (to a maximum of six).

Note that even if a unit is promoted to a hero, this does not lower the number of that type of unit currently in the warband for the purposes of unit caps.

For example, if you had six Marksmen in your Sellsword warband and one of them Promotes, you still count as having six Marksmen and cannot buy another one, unless either the Promoted Marksmen or one of the henchman Marksmen dies or is retired, as usual.

Additionally, note that the Promotion table for your warband lists the types of Skills that can be learned by a Promoted version of each unit type.

Units Promote before rolling for Scars. This means that if it was Incapacitated in the previous battle, it would first Promote and then roll on the Hero Scars Table.

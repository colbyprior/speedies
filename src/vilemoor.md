# Setting: The Ruined City of Viremoor
## Overview
Viremoor was once a glittering bastion of civilization — a nexus of trade, learning, and magic shared by all the known peoples of the world. Now it stands shattered, drowned in blood and shadow. The city fell not to war or famine, but to something far worse: the Red Blight, a demonic plague that twists flesh, warps minds, and calls forth the hungering abyss.

Viremoor is no longer a city of the living, but of the damned.

Yet in its crumbling bones lie vaults of arcane power, ancient relics, and secrets some would kill — or die — to possess. From blackened cathedrals to drowned catacombs, warbands now stalk the streets for salvation, vengeance, glory, or madness.

## The Red Blight
The plague that gutted Viremoor is not a disease in the mortal sense — it is a spiritual corruption, seeded by a failed summoning beneath the arcane university.
- Spreads by: Blood, breath, and will
- Symptoms: Hallucinations, mutations, eventual possession
- Victims become:
  - Horrors (twisted flesh-beasts)
  - Whispered (seemingly sane but possessed)
  - Revenants (undead puppets)

The Blight is unified by a hive-mind called The Chorus, an ancient demonic intelligence whispering from the void.

## City Districts
Each skirmish board represents a fragment of Viremoor’s cursed sprawl. Below are common districts warbands fight over:

### The Broken Spire
- Arcane ruins with floating rubble and unstable magic. 
- Mutating energy storms and gravity-defying debris.

### The Chapel Quarter
- Crumbling temples, desecrated altars, cursed relics. 
- Blighted priests and shrine guardians still haunt the aisles.

### The Warrens Below
- Twisting sewer tunnels filled with filth, ratmen, and plague-beasts. 
- Narrow corridors and sudden ambushes.

### The Market Graves
- Former trade hub; now a scavenger’s graveyard.
- Stalls, broken statues, and sludge-filled gutters.

### The Silent Garden
- A corrupted park, overgrown with fungal trees and bleeding statues.
- Whispers say something vast sleeps beneath the soil.

## Factions & Warbands
Warbands enter Viremoor for different reasons. Here are common types:

### Human Remnants
- Mercenaries, knights, or cultists surviving the collapse.
- Goals: Purge, profit, or prophecy.

### Elven Reclaimers
- Silent, aloof, and deadly. Seeking lost relics or balance. 
- Goal: Restoration through blood.

### Dwarven Delvers
- Treasure-hunters, engineers, and runepriests. 
- Goal: Reclaim or destroy lost technology and forges.

### Undead Covens
- Necromancers, bone constructs, and lich acolytes. 
- Goal: Expand undeath, harvest corpses.

### Vampiric Houses
- Aristocratic predators manipulating from the shadows. 
- Goal: Feed on the chaos and outlast the Blight.

### Ratkin Swarms
- Hyper-adaptive, plague-aligned scavengers. 
- Goal: Overrun the surface and breed in blight.

### The Chorus-Touched
- Cults, beasts, and mutated horrors serving the Red Blight. 
- Goal: Spread corruption and serve the demonic will.

## Themes
- No one is innocent – Every faction is morally grey or worse. 
- Everything decays – Structures crumble, faith falters, heroes fall. 
- You are expendable – Warbands rise and fall. Death is constant. 
- The city watches – Viremoor is alive. The Blight has will.

## Why Enter Viremoor?
Your warband’s purpose affects their behavior and campaign goals:
- Purge the Unclean – Zealots, crusaders, and inquisitors. 
- Claim the Relics – Treasure seekers and arcanists. 
- Control the Blight – Cultists and heretics. 
- Rescue & Revenge – Survivors and vengeance-driven souls. 
- Feed the Dark – Vampires, necromancers, or mad prophets.

## Campaign
- Track warband development over time: injuries, corruption, relics, curses. 
- Viremoor will evolve between games — introduce changing map zones or special events.
- Between missions, roll for:
  - Blight Surges 
  - Whispers from The Chorus 
  - Loot Finds 
  - Territory Gains/Losses
